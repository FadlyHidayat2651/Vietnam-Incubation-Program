# watson Discovery Set-Up Process

## Introduction
_Watson Discovery is an award-winning AI-powered intelligent search and text-analytics platform that eliminates data silos and retrieves information buried inside enterprise data. It uses innovative, market-leading natural language processing (NLP) to uncover meaningful business insights from documents, webpages, and big data. Watson Discovery makes it possible to rapidly build cognitive, cloud-based exploration applications that unlock actionable insights hidden in unstructured data including your own proprietary data, as well as public and third-party data._

You can use the following document to upload, follow the same process as before.

## Additional Feature of watson Discovery
### OCR 

Apart from being able to retrieve information from PDF or Docx files, Watson Discovery also has the capability to upload text files in the form of images and can be OCRed directly.
#### 1.Create a New Collection and Upload your Document

Make sure to turn on the OCR feature when you upload your document

<img width="1728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/watsonx-incubation-2/assets/105551267/1901d1ea-46a3-4259-bd4d-bdebabb0a1e4">

#### 2. Click Finish then go to Manage and Collection

Wait until Document Processing is complete.

Apart from that, you can crawl more than one website

<img width="467" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/watsonx-incubation-2/assets/105551267/e246ce0e-59c2-4272-bacd-82659dea0986">

Finally, click Finish and wait for the process to complete.

### Smart Document Understanding

In the process of understanding a document, sometimes on each page there will be several fields, such as header, sub header, text, and page. But when we try to read the document directly from the PDF, we cannot extract the information. By using SDU we can define fields on several pages which will then automatically be reflected on all existing pages.

Pilih use your trained model

<img width="1728" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Client-Engineering-Indonesia/watsonx-incubation-2/assets/105551267/bcd02238-a861-4878-81c8-bcdd9516ae76">

Then you can see the following display, select the labels field which is on the rightmost toggle. Select a specific field then mark the field in your document, click submit page. Repeat this process on several file sheets. Then at the end you will see that all pages have been identified.
