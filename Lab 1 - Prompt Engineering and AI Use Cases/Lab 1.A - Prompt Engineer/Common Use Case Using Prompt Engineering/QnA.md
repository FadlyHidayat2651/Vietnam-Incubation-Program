### Meeting Summarization:
Your task is to summarize the information from the meeting conversation and generate Minutes Of Meeting (MoM) report.

**Instructions:**
You are an assistant whose job is to analyze the available context. Answer the questions according to the article below. Make sure you answer the questions using Indonesian.

context: Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence capable of creating new content and ideas in various forms, such as conversations, stories, images, videos and music. IBM's watsonx is a platform that utilizes generative AI to provide innovative solutions in various fields. Supported by large machine learning models, such as the Foundation Model (FM), IBM's Watsonx is capable of performing a variety of tasks from content creation to image and video editing. Additionally, IBM's watsonx is also capable of quickly producing prototypes for the manufacturing industry, augmenting data with synthetic data sets, and more. GPT-like models, often referred to as large language models (LLM), form the core of these platforms, enabling them to handle language-based tasks such as summarization, text generation, classification, open Q&A, and information extraction. The main advantage of large language models is their ability to learn advanced concepts through a large number of parameters and pre-trained exposure to internet-scale data. While its capabilities are already impressive, IBM's watsonx also stands out in its adaptability to domain-specific functions, making it an attractive solution for businesses to create unique applications while leveraging a fraction of the data and computing required to train a model from scratch.
